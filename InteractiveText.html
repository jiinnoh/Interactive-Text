“This is what I think,” <em> I said at last. </em> “Ideas take their energy from the perceptions of others.”

“Affirmative!” <em> the Commendatore said cheerfully. He nodded several times. </em> “You have a good head on your shoulders. Ideas cannot exist outside the perceptions of others—those perceptions are our sole source of energy.” 
</p>

<p class="character">
“So then if I think, ‘The Commendatore doesn’t exist,’ you cease to exist. Right?”
</p>

<p class="commendatore">
“Negative! In theory, you have a point,” <em> the Commendatore said. </em> “But only in theory. In reality, that is quite unrealistic. One is hard put to will oneself to cease thinking about a given matter. Namely, to determine to ‘stop thinking’ about something is itself a thought—as long as one follows that path, that something continues to exist. In the end, to stop thinking about something means to stop thinking about stopping thinking.”
</p>

<p class="character">
“In other words,” <em> I said, </em> “it’s impossible for people to escape Ideas unless they lose either their memory or their interest in Ideas.”
